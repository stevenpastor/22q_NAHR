Paper for 22q NAHR

* Two scripts available for the localized assembly and alignment confirmation of 22q11.2 optical mapping haplotypes.

* Preparation for local <em>de novo assembly</em>: First is the alignment of molecules to all chromosomes except chr22.

* Haplotype confirmation: Second is the alignment of molecules to individual haplotypes of LCR22A and LCR22D for confirmation of correct assembly.
